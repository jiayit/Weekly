## 生活
 > 突然发现生活的本质好像是， 无数次想kick you down， 然后再重新站起来
> Suddenly I found out that the essence of life seems to be that it wants to kick you down, but you need to stand up again and again.

 > 一直保持主体化的视角真的很难，尤其遇到一些磁场很糟糕的人
> It is hard to keep a subjective personalization all the time, especially when you meet people with bad magnetic fields.

> life is always cruel, just like the wolves: they need to fight to live, and peace is always temporary.

> Charge:
> books : 人体简史；孤独的力量：内心
> my journal
> speeches: jobs and taylor
