## Study
- started to get used to life in Leiden.
- (SDPM)It is interesting to have a meeting with the Dutch company and hoping to do some engaging projects.
- (Multimedia Systems)It is good to brainstorm with other people and teamwork make things easier; There is no right or wrong answer for the assignment. Students can come up with different solutions.
- (ADM)Finally I saw how pushy and driven the Indian people are at teamwork.


## Life
- Interpersonal relationships changed a lot. people have to respect you if you keep independent and respect yourself(ignore and avoid interacting with rude people).
- 痛苦的清醒，还是快乐的麻木？
