## Study
- started to get used to the life in leiden.
- It is interesting to have meeting with the dutch company and hoping to do some engaging projects.
- It is good to have a brainstorm with other people and teamwork make things easier.
- Finally I saw how pushy and driven the indian people are at the teamwork.

## Life
- Interpersonal relationships changed a lot. people have to respect you if you keep independent and respect yourself(ignore and avoid interacting with rude people).
- 痛苦的清醒，还是快乐的麻木？
